Project: Car Price Prediction Model
- Objective: Developed a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of used cars, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of pricing predictions.
-Models Used: Implemented Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors.
-Random Forest Regressor: Achieved an R-squared score of 0.915 and an RMSE of 3305.46, capturing 91.5% of the variance in car prices.
-Gradient Boosting Regressor: Achieved an R-squared score of 0.629 and an RMSE of 6895.12, capturing 62.9% of the variance in car prices.
-Dataset: Utilized a dataset comprising various car specifications, including car ID, symbolling, car name, fuel type, aspiration, number of doors, car body, drive wheel, engine location, and other relevant features.
